# This script will convert all of the dicoms in the sourcedir
# for participant directories that are listed in the subject_list.txt file.
# Niftis will be renamed and put into BIDS structure using the dcm2Bids package
#
# See the dcm2Bids repo for instructions to create the config file:
# https://github.com/cbedetti/Dcm2Bids
#
# More detailed instructions on san wiki:
